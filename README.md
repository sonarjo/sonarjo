- 👋 Hi, I’m Joachim
- 👀 as a security consultant and enthusiast, I’m interested in input validation and how tools (SAST or the like) can support that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and testing XML/DTD and SOAP/XSD validation
- 💞️ I created this repo to support the disucssion @ https://community.sonarsource.com/t/input-validations-in-c-net-web-applications/46309/4
- 📫 and you are welcome to join that disucssion.
